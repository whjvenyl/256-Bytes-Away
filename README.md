I simply love tiny little libraries and since I write a lot of them I decided that I would put them all to one repo. The goal is to to never exceed 200 bytes limit per one minified and zipped library. I use Uglify3 with default options for minification and defalate for zipping. If you ever get an idea for a tiny library be sure to let me know. Hope you find these libraries helpful.
